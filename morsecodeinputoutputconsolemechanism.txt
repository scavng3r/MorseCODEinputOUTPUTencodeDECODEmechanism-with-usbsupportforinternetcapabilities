morse code input encode/decode mechanism


have morse code unit/tapper and utilize usb input by retrofit //maybe even with the tap mechanism on a cellphone screen??!saves the 
trouble of attching a usb to a morsecode device...still cool tho..


//create start of code here vvvvv

simple 11111111<->00000000 on off beep or silence input and output encoder/decoder

when system is hung at <-> (somehow) it wait for input in binary tap  8tap becomes
and encoded message from the binary output from a delimiter string = space

then resumes normal operation and send the morse through internet channels or data feeds or soundoutputs or whatever

 daemon 2 (lets call it taptastic)
which would be running and listening for ports or data output in binary (maybe even a new way to get binary data realtime from cpu?!!)
and then of course simple 11111111<->00000000 decode for output

issues seen in idea storming

- problems with machine reading timings and actually inputing inside binary given to 11111111<->00000000 rule

there would need to be a delay @input and not decode
decode would need to take in 8 tap (coolname>??)    8tap=(binary) encoded message









so decode/ascii-8tap = binary text output
