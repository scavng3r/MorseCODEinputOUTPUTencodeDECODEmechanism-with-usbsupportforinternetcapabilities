morse code input decode mechanism


have morse code unit/tapper and utilize usb input by retrofit

//create start of code here vvvvv

simple 11111111<->00000000 on off beep or silence input and output encoder/decoder

when system is hung at <-> (somehow) it wait for input in binary tap

then resumes normal operation and send the morse through internet channels or data feeds or soundoutputs or whatever

 daemon 2 (lets call it taptastic)
which would be running and listening for ports or data output in binary (maybe even a new way to get binary data realtime from cpu?!!)
and then of course simple 11111111<->00000000 decode for output
